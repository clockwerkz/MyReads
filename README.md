This is the reponsitory for the MyReads Book Ap project. This project features making use of React to render a sample Book Shelf with a number of books categorized as either 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read', or 'Read'. The books can be switched from shelf to shelf in real time, and also removed from the shelves altogether.
There is an accompaning search page that can be used to search for book categories. Those books returned in the search can be added to any shelf as well.
